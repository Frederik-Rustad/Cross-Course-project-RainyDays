1. Summary

My journey through my first real project of making a web site. With all my trials and tribulations along the way from desing to consept.


2. Main section of report

While going through the exercises and lesson tasks in the HTML and CSS -Module 1-4, I started whith the Course Assignment simultaneously, that  in turn made me start with the Desktop version and scaling it down later and not the other way around.
It wasn’t until later, where every video tutorial I watched said to start with Mobile and scale up, but I was already rather far along and desided to just continue.

The most noticable change from the Design-1 to now is the nav bar that got a minor facelift. The new Navigation bar has sligtly more compact elements instead of covering the entire length of the header.
The rest of the site is pretty much the same as the original design.
 

I had a couple of pop-up’s for the indication of successfully added item to cart and order complete, that gave me some trouble and I ended up following some tutorials to code alongside (mainly Traversy Media, see 3.References)


The hamburger menu as well gave me some trouble, where every method I looked up needed JavaScript. Until much later when I figured out to just use a simple dropdown menu instead. 


The down scaling didn’t give me as much trouble as I first anticipated, but next time I’ll start with Mobile and work my way up.

The navigation bar could have had more work on it and scince I honestly didn’t figure out the mobile dropdown menu until the end is the reason there is two nav’s and for the lowest @ Media the first one is just hidden in favor of the dropdown menu. I just ran out of time to make them one responsive one.
