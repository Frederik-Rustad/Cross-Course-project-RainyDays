My journey through my first real project of making a web site. With all my trials and tribulations along the way from desing to consept.
Rainydays is a Ecommerce web store page for Durable and confortable jackets.

## Description

 I have created an e-commerce website focused on selling rain jackets. 
 The project aims to simulate the development and launch of an online store that specializes in rainwear. 
 This includes the design, development, and implementation of a user-friendly and visually appealing website where customers can browse,
 select, and purchase various rain jacket products.

# Website Design and Layout:

- Create an intuitive and user-friendly website layout that provides easy navigation.
- Choose a color scheme and design elements that resonate with the theme of rain jackets and outdoor activities.
- Ensure that the website is responsive and accessible on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

# Product Catalog:

- Organize the products into categories (e.g., men's, women's, different styles,).
Include high-quality images and detailed product descriptions for each item.

# E-commerce Functionality:

- Implement a shopping cart system that allows customers to add and remove products.
